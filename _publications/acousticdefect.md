**Abstract:**
Weld penetration control has emerged as a critical area of research in the field of online control 
for ensuring the quality of robotic welds. Acoustic signals, which are known for their distinct 
temporal characteristics, play a pivotal role in the online assessment of weld quality. This study 
proposes a novel filter bank specifically tailored for robotic welding and investigates the working 
environment of robot welding. Twenty-six time-domain and frequency-domain features were extracted 
from weld acoustic signals, and statistical analyses and comparative methods were used to identify 
variations in defective signal features and interpret their physical significance. By leveraging 
these acoustic signal characteristics, this study established a predictive identification model 
and an online feedback controller. The predictive identification model effectively identified 
different penetration levels in the welding process, and the identification results served as a 
reference input for online regulation of the welding speed by the controller. Additionally, a 
digital twin system was developed, where the identification model and controller functioned as 
digital objects on a computer and an edge computer, respectively. Experimental tests demonstrated 
the superior performance of the system and model in accurately reflecting welding process 
penetration, regulating and stabilising the welding speed, and significantly enhancing the 
welding quality. The research presented in this paper offers notable advantages for the online 
control of welding penetration.
