**Abstract:**
In the era of Industry 4.0, human resources are an indispensable part of the production process, 
so the human-machine relationship in intelligent production is a very important theme. Based on 
the classical theory of digital twin and ergonomics, this paper discusses the expansion and 
internal relationship of ergonomics theory under the digital twin system and puts forward a 
concept of human-machine interaction under the digital twin system(HMDT). According to the concept
of HMDT, a universal digital twin system framework with the controller as the core is established 
and its parts are introduced. Finally, this paper tries to apply the digital twin system to 
industrial robots. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the human-machine interaction 
relationship in intelligent production and expect to propose a practical application to provide 
a reference for related research.
