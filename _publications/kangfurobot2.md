**Abstract:**
Aiming at the rehabilitation needs of patients with lower limb sports injuries,a new type of 
lower extremity exoskeleton rehabilitation training device was proposed. According to the RLA 
staging method in rehabilitation assessment,the description of normal gait and the characteristics
of human lower limbs and lower limb joints in ergonomics theory. Design the mechanism of the
passive rehabilitation trainer;use the establishment of the 3D prototype model and the physical
prototype;and establish the kinematics and dynamics model;analyze the characteristic curve of the 
joint motion through Matlab simulation,verify the correctness of the mathematical model;and pass 
the ADAMS The software performs dynamic simulation,verifies the normal walking gait of the model,
and obtains the joint torque variation curve,which provides a reference for the drive control.
